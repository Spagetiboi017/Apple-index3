<h3> Red Delicous </h3>

<p> The Red Delicous is not at all delicious according to <a href="https://applerankings.com/">Apple Ranking.com <a/>  simply because its name
lied, it was also bred to have hard skin for shipping, ( I also don't really like it either.) </p>

<p> Details: The Red delicous was ranked 25 in the Apple ranks, (which is really low ) the Red Delicous was discovered by Jesse Hiatt
in the state of Iowa in the 1870's , it was made to be "Delicous" but then mass production turned it into a non "Delicous" apple</p>

<h3> Granny Smith </h3>

<p> The Granny Smith is a tough and sour green apple, while useful for making apple pies it was also used for making sour candy which by my standards are delicous.<br>
The Granny Smith was supposed to be the better version of Red Delicous and it was.</p>

<p> Details: The Granny Smith was ranked 57 in the Apple ranks, ( which is okay ) The Granny Smith orginated from Sydney Austrailia and got knicknamed after Maria "Granny" Smith
who discovered it in 1868.

<h3> Honey Crisp </h3>

<p> The Honey Crisp is a sweet and crisp apple made to be quality fruit for the winters in Minnesota, The Honeycrisp was called the "Best Apple of all Time " until they had a competitor</p>
 <p> Details:The Honey Crisp was ranked 95 in the Apple ranks ( Thats really good ), if you doubt that Honey crisp tastes good try one its in Fresh Co, Sobeys, and others </p>

<h3> Golden Delicous </h3> 

<p> The Golden Delicious has a distinguished look and just like its "brother" the Red Delicious its not Delicious.(but its good in pies ) </p>
<p>Details: The Golden Delicicous was ranked 33 in the Apple ranks, (which is really low just like its "brother")</p>

<h3> Pink Lady </h3>
 <p> The Pink Lady is a nice crisp and juicy apple,Given its looks its instantly reconizible from the produce section in your grocery stores. </p>
<p> Details: The Pink Lady was ranked 86 in the Apple ranks, (Pretty good ) The Pink Lady also Originated from Austrailia Just like Granny Smith 
overall its good </p>
